    "# Web Server\n",
    "\n",
    "One purpose for a web server in our application is to fetch the sensors' data from the database and to provide the visualization of said data which includes an interactive map and graph. Another purpose would be to receive sensor data from a Arduino and sending that data to the database. Eventhough data from sensors could be sent directly to the database through HTTP requests, this method is far superior since this allows us to interchange different database without having to change anything on the Arduino(sensor) side, all with minimal overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have chosen to use Python for the web server because all mentioned databases have Python libraries in which we have made scripts for, thus ensuring that compatibility will not be an issue. The web server framework that we used is Flask, this is because it is popular, fast and heavily documented.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Flask Set up\n",
    "[Official Documentation](http://flask.pocoo.org/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply run the command `pip install flask` to install. Once installed, you must set your python web server file as an environment variable done by running the command `FLASK_APP=server.py flask run` where in this case server.py is the filename. By default, this should run the webserver on `localhost:5000`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: To run on Windows run the command `set FLASK_APP=server.py` and then `flask run`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### HTTP Request Format to Send Sensor Data to Database(sendData endpoint)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the HTTP request format example that the web server takes from the Arduino(GET request)\n",
    "\n",
    "localhost:5000/sendData?numData=2&type1=...&id1=...&value1=...&type2=...&id2=..&value2=...\n",

    "\n",
    "* numData is the number of data points that will be given\n",
    "\n",
    "* idX is the sensor ID. We need a sensor ID because the hardware setup is as follows. There are multiple nodes each connected to a sensor, these nodes will then send their data to the central Arduino Server which then sends all the data to the web server using HTTP request. Each of the nodes that send to Arduino should be numbered to know which data comes from which node, this number is the sensor ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "* type is the type of measurement done, for example `DO`,`EC`,`temperature` and `turbidity`\n",
    "\n",
    "* value is the value that the sensor outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time of writing this document, the person working on the Arduino and sensors was not able to send a timestamp of when the sensor data was collected, thus a timestamp query field is not present. In the future, this can be easily added by modifying the sendData endpoint in the file `server.py` to add a variable that takes the query from the URL. Currently, the data is timestamped automatically by InfluxDB when inserted to the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Reasoning behind the format: \n",
    "\n",
    "Sending data with a GET request in this format is inspired by [ThingSpeak](https://thingspeak.com/), which is a website that provides a service that allows sending sensor data through HTTP requests. The person working on the Arduino prefers the format that GET request offers, since it is shorter and easier to do because for our purposes we are only sending only up to two sensor data at a time. Also, ThingSpeak provides a way to send data through POST requests, however,  in this case one must send data in a JSON formatted body. If you want to change the server to be able to receive POST request change the sendData endpoint decorator to `@app.route(\"/sendData\",methods =[\"POST\"])`, and change the code inside it to parse a JSON body accordingly instead of getting the query parameters.
