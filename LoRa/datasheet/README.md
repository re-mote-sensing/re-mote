Forced line breaks in the pdf (and when copy and pasting) strongly affect the quality of the translation and should be removed.

### 100mW LoRa 433/490/868/915MHz MESH wireless data transmission module YL-800N
>   Translated from http://www.rf-module.cn/product/433/141.html

This is a 7-level distributed distributed MESH mesh self-organizing network wireless data transmission module. 

The module uses STM8L low-power microcontroller processor, which is enough to support complex mesh ad hoc network protocol, and has low power consumption. Supports route discovery/automatic route discovery/forced route discovery/source route multiple networking modes. The user does not need to perform secondary development on the module, nor does it need to control the networking process. It only needs to provide data according to the hexadecimal data frame format, which can be easily networked. 

The wireless communication part of the module is based on the LoRa spread-spectrum modulation technology of Semtech Sx1276/Sx1278, which has ultra-high receiving sensitivity, strong anti-interference ability and long-term stable data transmission capability. The module has an average transmission distance of 20dBm in an open environment and a single-hop line-of-sight distance of 1km. When many modules have a maximum array network, the entire network can cover a radius of about 7km. 

The user can use the parameter setting software provided by our company on the computer, or modify the frequency (channel), transmission power, device type, network address, module address, interface mode, serial port of the module according to the AT command communication protocol. Parameters such as rate, check digit, stop bit, air rate, signal bandwidth, and spreading factor. 

MESH mesh ad hoc network is a distributed peer-to-peer network, which can make full use of routing redundancy in the network. It has excellent network self-healing, stability and excellent data throughput. Its networking time is very short. All devices are powered on and work.
