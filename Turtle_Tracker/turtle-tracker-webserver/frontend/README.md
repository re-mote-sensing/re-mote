# Overview

This is a React-based Web App designed to be used on the Turtle Tracker project. It provides a map that plots the locations of the trackers in real-time.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Dependencies

`react-leaflet` >= 3.2.0
`leaflet` >= 1.7.1
`sass` >= 1.52.0
`react` >= 17.0.2
`react-dom` >= 17.0.2
`react-scripts` >= 4.0.3
`react-select` >= 5.3.2
`react-sliding-pane` >= 7.1.0
`react-i18next` >= 11.16.9
`web-vitals` >= 1.1.2

It is recommended that you install yarn as it is heavily used for dependency management and building from the command line

`yarn` >= 1.22.10

## Project Structure

In the main directory `package-lock.json`, `package.json` and `yarn.lock` are all files that are used when building the project or installing new depedencies. They do not need to be modified directly.

**The two directories that are of most concern to the developer are `src` and `public`.**

`src` contains all source code files used by the application, any new code will go here.

`public` contains asset files such icons as well as the `index.html`, `manifest.json` and `robots.txt`. New asset files go here. The other files do not need to be modified under normal circumstances.

`build` contains the result of the `npm run build` command. This is the directory that is used by the backend server to serve the site. None of the contents need to be modified directly.

`node-modules` contains all the dependencies used by React and should not be modified.

## Building

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
