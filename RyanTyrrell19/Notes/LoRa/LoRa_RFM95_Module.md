# Overview

# Neat Features

* Low Battery Detector
	* A low battery detector is also included allowing the generation of an interrupt signal in response to the supply voltage dropping below a programmable threshold that is adjustable through the register RegLowBat. The interrupt signal can be mapped to any of the DIO pins by programming RegDioMapping.


* Beacon Mode
	* In some short range wireless network topologies a repetitive message, also known as beacon, is transmitted periodically by a transmitter. The Beacon Tx mode allows for the re-transmission of the same packet without having to fill the FIFO multiple times with the same data.

* Built-in Temperature Sensor
	* A stand alone temperature measurement block is used in order to measure the temperature in any mode except Sleep and Standby. 
	* Due to process variations, the absolute accuracy of the result is +/- 10 Â°C. Higher precision requires a calibration procedure at a known temperature. The figure below shows the influence of just such a calibration process.

* Caution: Developing this type of software and using data radios successfully is challenging and requires a substantial knowledge base in software and radio and data transmission technologies and theory. It may not be an appropriate project for beginners. If you are a beginner, you will need to spend some time gaining knowledge in these areas first.
