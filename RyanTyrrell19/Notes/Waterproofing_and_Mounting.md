# Waterproofing Methods

* 3D print a streamline case that encomopasses the Tracker and is attached using screws. Epoxy can be spread along any cracks to ensure no leaks will exist
    * Much like the small, black cause made for the GPS
    * Could design it so the LoRa antenna is sticking outside the case
