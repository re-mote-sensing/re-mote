# Waterproofing Methods

* 3D print a streamline case that encomopasses the Tracker and is attached using screws. Epoxy can be spread along any cracks to ensure no leaks will exist
    * Much like the small, black cause made for the GPS
    * Could design it so the LoRa antenna is sticking outside the case


*  In these cases you should consider post processing your print to seal the surface. The **ABS smoothing technique with acetone** could do this, or you could add an **epoxy mix like XTC-3D to smooth and seal the surface**. Finally, there are a number of **conventional sealants one could use, including paint**. [1]

* Plastic Spray paint
* Conformal coating
* Painting the print with epoxy


* need to let battert gases/heat escape?
