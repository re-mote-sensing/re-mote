STEP#1:
Once you download the .ipt files for a box, please open and convert them into .stl files using Autodesk Inventor software. 

OR

Download the .stl files from the STL folder.

STEP#2:
Download and install the slicer software (preferably, follow the link: https://www.prusa3d.com/drivers/  - PrusaSlicer
OR 
download any of the other slicing softwares, such as Cura
OR
if you know the type of your 3D printer, perhaps check their online website - most likely, the 3D printer company provides a slicing software for free)

STEP#3:
Open .stl files in the slicer software, and re-arrange the items on the virtual bed in order to keep them within the boundaries (most slicers have the option to self-arrange and self-orient the parts while keeping the run-time at minimum).

STEP#4:
Adjust the print settings according to your needs (or you can use the default settings). Please change a few parameters to see how it affects the run-time, for example, in the 'Print Settings' option, if you select the finest bead size, it would increase the print time. 
- Select the right filament type and printer type
- Recommended to enable the Support and Brim option 
- Keep the scale factor at 100% to print correctly sized parts 

STEP#5:
After setting and verifying all the options available to you, hit Slice button. This would generate a G-code for the 3D printer and calculate the amount of time to finish the job.
- Export the G-code in a folder (or, directly into an SD card)

STEP#6:
Insert the SD card in the printer SD card slot. Find the G-code file name from the list, and hit the print button. 
- Make sure to clean the printer's bed with isopropyl alcohol/cleaning agent
- Suggestion: After selecting the right file name, let the printer run for the first layer and inspect that the material is sticking to the bed. If not, clean the bed or use a sticking solution, or adjust the z-axis.
