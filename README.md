## 📒 About re:mote

### Low-cost Water Quality Sensing and Turtle Tracking

This is a software and hardware infrastructure for long-term monitoring of water quality parameters and seasonal monitoring of turtle movements that normally cost a lot more to make, but you can do it by yourself at a fraction of the price compared to commercial products.

### Arduino-based motes

- Can be configure with different sensors and different forms.
    - Different network options.
    - Different sensors.
    - Different enclosure.
- Low power cunsumption and can be deployed to remote areas.

The network consists of:
- **Gateway** (one or multiple) to relay end-node data to the server over the
internet using a 3G connection.
- **End Nodes** (one or multiple) to measure water quality parameters through attached sensors.
    - **pH** sensor shows the acidity or alkalinity, helping to detect imbalances.
    - **Conductivity** sensor reveals the amount of salts present, providing insight into water quality.
    - **Dissolved Oxygen** sensor measures oxygen levels in the water, indicating the health of aquatic life.
    - **Water Temperature** sensor helps calibrate all sensor levels.
    - **Turbidity** sensor indicates water clarity, with changes signalling potential disturbances.
    - **[Custom sensors](/Documentation/Water_Sensor/Custom_Sensors.md)**

### Server

For real-time monitoring, the Raspberry Pi is an affordable option. However, a regular PC can also be utilized if preferred.

The server is programmed in Golang for fast and concurrent connections.
- A progressive web application designed in React with a custom API.
    - A Progressive Web Application (PWA) enables you to access and browse your data conveniently on your phone.
    - A custom API facilitates easy integration with various other systems.
- A time-series database (InfluxDB) for simple data storage and a smaller footprint. Time series databases assume that insertions are more frequent than queries, so it allows for the fast insertion of large amounts of data, such as water quality data.

## 🛰 LoRa & Mesh Network

### Low-power long-range sensor network

A LoRa mesh network is optionally used for connecting motes (nodes can operate standalone).
- It is a low-bandwidth, low-power, and long-range network.
- The mesh network is tolerant to faults, changing network topology, extension, and contraction.
