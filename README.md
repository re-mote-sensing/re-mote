## üìí About re:mote

### Low-cost Water Quality Sensing and Turtle Tracking

This is a software and hardware infrastructure for long-term monitoring of water quality parameters and seasonal monitoring of turtle movements that normally cost a lot more to make, but you can do it by yourself at a fraction of the price compared to commercial products.

### Arduino-based motes

- Can be configure with different sensors and different forms.
    - Different network options.
    - Different sensors.
    - Different enclosure.
- Low power cunsumption and can be deployed to remote areas.

The network consists of:
- **Gateway** (one or multiple) to relay end-node data to the server over the
internet using a 3G connection.
- **End Nodes** (one or multiple) to measure water quality parameters through attached sensors.
    - **pH** sensor shows the acidity or alkalinity, helping to detect imbalances.
    - **Conductivity** sensor reveals the amount of salts present, providing insight into water quality.
    - **Dissolved Oxygen** sensor measures oxygen levels in the water, indicating the health of aquatic life.
    - **Water Temperature** sensor helps calibrate all sensor levels.
    - **Turbidity** sensor indicates water clarity, with changes signalling potential disturbances.
    - **[Custom sensors](Documentation/Software/Custom_Sensors.md)**

### Raspberry Pi Server

Used for real-time monitoring, the Raspberry Pi is inexpensive and can also use a regular PC.

A server programmed in Go for fast and concurrent connections.
- A progressive web application designed in React with a custom API.
    - Progressive web application allows you to browse your data on your phone.
    - Custom API makes it easily integrate with other systems.
- A time-series database (InfluxDB) for simple data storage and a smaller footprint. Time series databases assume that insertions are more frequent than queries, so it allows for the fast insertion of large amounts of data, such as water quality data.

## üõ∞ LoRa & Mesh Network

### Low-power Long-range Sensor Network

A LoRa mesh network is optionally used for connecting motes (nodes can operate standalone).
- It is a low-bandwidth, low-power, and long-range network.
- The mesh network is tolerant to faults, changing network topology, extension, and contraction.
