## üìí About re:mote

### Low-cost Water Quality Sensing and Turtle Tracking

The goal is to develop with project partners software and hardware infrastructure for long-term monitoring of water quality parameters and seasonal monitoring of turtle movements.

### Arduino-based motes

- Software correctness is a must
- Unreliable communication, changing network topology, long distances
- Limited power supply: low-frequency processors, low-power modes

The network consists of Arduino-based motes:
- Gateway to relay end-node data to the server over the
internet using a 3G connection.
- End nodes to measure water quality parameters through connected sensors.

### Raspberry Pi Server

- Large amounts of simply-structured data
- Erroneous data with ‚Äúreal‚Äù anomalies
- Visualization and further programmatic analysis

A server programmed in Go for fast and concurrent connections.
- A progressive web application designed in React with a custom API.
- A time-series database (InfluxDB) for simple data storage and a smaller footprint. Time series databases assume insertions are more frequent than queries, so it allows for the fast insertion of large amounts of data such as water quality data.

## üõ∞ LoRa & Mesh Network

### Low-power Long-range Sensor Network

A LoRa mesh network is used for connecting motes.
- It is a low-bandwidth, low-power and long-range network.
- The mesh network is tolerant to faults, changing network topology, extension and contraction.
- Initially, the sensors used are commercial off-the-shelf sensors for dissolved oxygen, pH, electrical conductivity, temperature, etc.
