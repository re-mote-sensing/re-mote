## üìí About re:mote

### Low-cost Water Quality Sensing and Turtle Tracking

This is a software and hardware infrastructure for long-term monitoring of water quality parameters and seasonal monitoring of turtle movements which normally cost 10k or more to make, but you can do it by yourself with 1/10 of the price.

### Arduino-based motes

- Can be config with different sensors and different forms
- They have Unreliable long distances communications, network topology always changing
- Limited power supply in remote area

The network consists of Arduino-based motes:
- **Gateway** to relay end-node data to the server over the
internet using a 3G connection.
- **End Nodes** to measure water quality parameters through connected sensors.
    - **pH** shows the acidity or alkalinity, helping detect imbalances.
    - **Conductivity** sensor reveals the amount of salts present, providing insight into water quality.
    - **Dissolved Oxygen** sensor measures oxygen levels in the water, indicating the health of aquatic life.
    - **Water Temperature** sensor helps calibrate all sensor levels.
    - **Turbidity** sensor indicates water clarity, with changes signalling potential disturbances.
    - **[Custom Sensors](Documentation/Software/Custom_Sensors.md)**

### Raspberry Pi Server

- Large amounts of simply-structured data
- Erroneous data with ‚Äúreal‚Äù anomalies
- Visualization and further programmatic analysis

A server programmed in Go for fast and concurrent connections.
- A progressive web application designed in React with a custom API.
- A time-series database (InfluxDB) for simple data storage and a smaller footprint. Time series databases assume insertions are more frequent than queries, so it allows for the fast insertion of large amounts of data such as water quality data.

## üõ∞ LoRa & Mesh Network

### Low-power Long-range Sensor Network

A LoRa mesh network is a optional used for connecting motes. [YL-800N Datasheet](https://gitlab.cas.mcmaster.ca/re-mote/arduino-motes/-/blob/master/Documentation/Data%20Sheets/LoRa_MESH_Radio_YL-800N_EN.pdf)
- It is a low-bandwidth, low-power and long-range network.
- The mesh network is tolerant to faults, changing network topology, extension and contraction.
